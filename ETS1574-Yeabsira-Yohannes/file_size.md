    # problem analysis

        ### inputs:
        1.fuel capacity in gallon.
        2.miles pergallon.

       ###  output:
        1.total miles an automobile can be driven without refueling.

        ### optations:
        1.declare variables for fuel capacity,milesper gallon and total miles before refueling.
        2.read inputs.
        3.calculate the total miles before refueling as **total miles = fuelcapacity * miles pergallon**.
        4.print the total miles.
        
   #   Algorithm    
    ## pseudocode
        step 1.start the program.
        step 2.read the fuel capacity and miles pergallon.
        step 3.calculate the total miles as **total miles = fuel capacity * miles pergallon**.
        step 4.print the total miles.
        step 5.end the program.
